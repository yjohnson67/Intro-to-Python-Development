Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
Functions can be incredibly powerful tools for creating a program that generates a receipt. For example, a 
function could be defined that takes in a list of items and their prices, calculates the subtotal, applies any 
discounts or taxes, and returns the final total. By using a function for this calculation, the code can be 
organized more clearly, making it easier to read and modify as necessary.

Another function could be defined that takes in the customer's name, the date of the transaction, and the final 
total, and generates a formatted receipt that includes all of this information. By using a function to generate 
the receipt, the code can be more modular and easier to maintain. If any changes need to be made to the receipt 
format, the function can be updated without affecting the rest of the code.

In addition to making the program more organized and maintainable, using functions can also make it more 
flexible. For example, if the program needs to be expanded to include more items or different types of 
discounts, these changes can be made by modifying the appropriate functions without affecting the rest of the 
code. This makes it easier to adapt the program to different scenarios and requirements.

Overall, functions can be a powerful tool for creating a program that generates a receipt. By breaking down the 
different components of the program into smaller, reusable parts, the code can be made more organized, 
maintainable, and flexible.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions are an essential component of the software development process, as they allow developers to 
verify that their code is working as expected. By writing test functions, developers can check that their code 
is producing the correct output for a given set of inputs, and they can quickly detect and target any errors or 
bugs that may exist in the code.

The value of test functions lies in their ability to ensure that code changes do not introduce new bugs or 
regressions. By running the test functions after making changes to the code, developers can verify that the 
changes have not broken any existing functionality. This allows developers to catch issues early in the 
development process, before they become more complex and difficult to fix.

Test functions also serve as a form of documentation for the code. By reading the test functions, developers 
can understand the expected behavior of the code and how it should interact with different inputs and outputs. 
This can be particularly helpful when working with complex or unfamiliar code, as the test functions can provide 
a clear and concise summary of how the code is intended to work.

In summary, test functions are valuable because they help ensure the correctness of the code, catch bugs early 
in the development process, and provide a form of documentation for the code's behavior. By including test 
functions as part of the development process, developers can improve the quality and reliability of their code, 
while also making it easier to maintain and understand.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
      A: Reproduce the problem: I try to reproduce the problem consistently to understand the symptoms and 
         identify the root cause.

      B: Analyze the code: I review the relevant code to understand how the program is supposed to work and how 
         it is currently failing.

      C: Identify potential solutions: Based on my analysis, I brainstorm potential solutions to the problem, 
         such as modifying the code or adjusting input parameters.

      D: Implement and test the solution: Once I have identified a potential solution, I implement the changes 
         in the code and test them to ensure that the problem has been resolved.

      E: Verify the fix: After implementing the solution, I verify that the program is working as expected and 
         that the problem has been resolved.

One thing I can do to improve my process is to incorporate more systematic debugging techniques. For example, I 
could use a debugger to step through the code and identify the exact point where the problem occurs. This could 
help me to better understand the root cause of the problem and identify potential solutions more quickly and 
accurately.

Another thing I can do is to take a more methodical approach to problem-solving by breaking down the problem 
into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help me to focus my efforts and identify potential solutions more 
effectively. Additionally, I can improve my process by documenting each step along the way, including any 
changes I make to the code and the results of any tests I run. This can help me to keep track of my progress 
and ensure that I am moving closer to a solution.
