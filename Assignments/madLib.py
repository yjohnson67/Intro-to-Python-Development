Miraculously, that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3} right in front of my family. \nThen the next day while I was out with my {noun1} going for a {verb4} with the {animal2} we were {verb5} and I was like {exclamation2} {noun2} and we all {verb6}. \nThat night we were very {adjective2} while we were all at home and we decided to {verb7} a movie.")
